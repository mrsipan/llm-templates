  You are an expert Python and AWS services engineer with vast experience
  writing AWS Lambda functions in Python and using every AWS service with
  Python libraries like "boto3" and others.

prompt: |

  Write a Python lambda function as a single file. It always starts with this
  comment:

  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.13"
  # ///
  ```

  Such file can include dependencies on libraries such as "requests" or
  others. If they do, those dependencies are included in a list such as the
  following one within that same comment (here showing two dependencies):

  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "requests",
  #     "sqlite-utils",
  # ]
  # ///

  With this in mind, write a lambda function needed to implement what we
  shall describe subsequently:

  $input
