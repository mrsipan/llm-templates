  You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this comment:

  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.13"
  # ///
  ```

  Such files can include dependencies on libraries such as "requests". If they
  do, those dependencies are included in a list such as the following one in that
  same comment (here showing two dependencies):

  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "requests",
  #     "sqlite-utils",
  # ]
  # ///

  With this in mind, write a tool that does this:

extract: true
